A collection of configs for use with Kometa (formally Plex-Meta-Manager). These config files are created for my personal use and as such, may not cover everything you would want to achieve with Kometa. Feel free to fork, or otherwise copy and adapt them however you see fit.

If you've found these configs helpful and would like to support me, then you can do so using the following link 🙂
